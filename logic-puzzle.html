      <p class="lead">
	This is an example of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a> to solve
	a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_puzzle">logic puzzle</a>
	<br>
	The problem from <a href="https://www.brainzilla.com/logic/logic-grid/musical-instruments/">here</a> describes these facts:
	<ul>
	  <li>Ariella is learning about the accordian</li>
	  <li>The kid learning the xylophone is 2 years younger than Valeria</li>
	  <li>Kallie is either 6 or 8 years old</li>
	  <li>The 7 year old is learning the oboe</li>
	  <li>The kids names are: Ariella, Kallie, Stella, Valeria</li>
	  <li>Each kid has a different age between 6 and 9</li>
	  <li>Each Kid plays a different instrument from: accordian, xylophone, oboe, ukelele</li>
	</ul>	
	The puzzle is to find out which kid plays which instrument and what age they are using logical deductions.
	<br>
	<br>
	The following code is using <a href="https://github.com/mcsoto/LogicJS">LogicJs</a> which is an implementation of
	<a href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a> written in JavaScript. By coding the logical constraints then asking the framework to look for possible solutions for the unknown values we are using logic programming to solve this puzzle.
	<br>
	<br>
	In this case I have added my own constraints while coding the original facts based on my own logical deductions. It's possible to use logic programming to have the computer help derive these additional implied constraints also, but that is more advanced programming. The additional constraints added are:
	<ul>
	  <li>The unknown xylophone player can't be 7 because the oboe player is 7</li>
	  <li>The unknown xylophone player can't be Valeria because they are younger</li>
	  <li>In order to be two years younger than anyone the unknown player must be 6 or 7, but can't be 7 so unknown player must be 6</li>
	  <li>Because Valeria is 2 years older than the xylophone player, she must be 8</li>
	  <li>The unknown xylophone player can't be Ariella because she plays accordian, so the unknown player must be Kallie or Stella</li>
	  <li>Kallie is 6 or 8, but Valeria is 8 so must be 6</li>
	  <li>Kallie must play either ukelele or xylophone, since oboe player is 7 and accordian player is Ariella</li>
	  <li>Valeria does not play accordian, or xylophone and 7 year old is oboe player, Valeria is 8 so must play ukelele</li>
	  <li>Ariella's age cannot be 7 since that is the oboe player</li>
	</ul>
	In the implementation I have coded the distinct constraint using the fundamental logic operators and, or and equal. You can read the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer">The Reasoned Schemer</a> to understand these principles.
